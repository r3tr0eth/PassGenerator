## Generate a Strong Password
This project provides a Python function generate_password that can be used to generate a strong, random password.

### Installation
This project does not require any installation. Simply copy the generate_password function into your Python code and call it as needed.

### Usage
To generate a strong password, call the generate_password function. By default, the function will generate a password with a length of 16 characters:

```
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=16):
    """Generate a strong password with the specified length"""
    # Implementation here

password = generate_password()
print(password)
This will generate a random password with a length of 16 characters and print it to the console.
``` 

You can also specify a custom length for the password by passing an integer value to the length parameter:

```
password = generate_password(length=12)
print(password)
This will generate a random password with a length of 12 characters and print it to the console.
```

### How it Works
The generate_password function uses the string module to define the characters to use in the password, including lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. It then shuffles the list of all possible characters to create a random order and chooses the first length characters to create the password. Finally, it joins the password characters into a string and returns the result.

### Customization

You can customize the set of characters used in the password by modifying the all_chars variable in the generate_password function. You can also modify the default length of the password by modifying the length parameter in the function definition.
